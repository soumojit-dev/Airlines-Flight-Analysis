# ✈️ Airline Flight Price Analysis  
### A Data Exploration & Visualization Project using Python  
**By: Soumojit Maitra (B.Tech CSE — AIML, Year 2)**

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores how flight ticket prices vary across several factors such as:

- Airline type  
- Travel class (Economy vs Business)  
- Source and destination routes  
- Departure & arrival timings  
- Days left before departure  

The goal is to understand **pricing behavior**, uncover **patterns**, and present insights using **clear visualizations** and **structured analysis**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  

---

## 📊 Key Visual Insights  
The analysis includes the following visualizations:

- **Airline-wise ticket price comparison**  
- **Economy vs Business class fare trends**  
- **Source & destination city flight frequencies**  
- **Departure & arrival time distribution**  
- **Price variation by days left before travel**  
- **Route-based price fluctuations**  
- **Class-wise price trajectory over time**  
- **Airline-specific pricing trend (e.g., Vistara Business)**  

Each visualization is followed by a **concise, stakeholder-friendly summary**.

---

## 🔍 Summary of Findings  
- Premium carriers (e.g., Vistara, Air India) consistently price higher.  
- Business class fares remain elevated regardless of booking time.  
- Source–destination combinations heavily influence prices.  
- Peak-hour travel aligns with high fare ranges.  
- Prices stabilize as the departure date approaches, challenging the belief that early booking is always cheaper.
